Required modifications to the dumper

You should hook up jumpers to change these pins to their required position, but still able to change back to regular cart dumper.

Everything is done to "chip" 1 only

The "chip" is referred to a 28 pin chip from now on, ignoring pins 1,2,31,32 - I.E. pin 3 on the 32 pin chip is now pin 1 on the "28 pin chip"


CHANGES

Connect pin 20 of the "chip" to pin 6 on the VB edge

Connect pin 28 of the "chip" to pin 8 on the VB edge

Connect pin 7 on the VB edge to Vcc (pin 8 on the VB edge) - for some reason the VB SRAM controller has problems giving power to CS2 quickly enough, so you have to manually power it.
