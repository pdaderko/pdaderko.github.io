<h1>Reprogrammable Flash Cartridge</h1>
<img src="flash/InVB.jpg" height="267" width="490">
<p>Here is my reprogrammable Flash cart, which is based on my
EPROM cart, except as you can tell, it is a lot smaller, and to
reprogram, the chips are erased inside the device that programs them,
so it is a much faster and easier process. Although this cart could
have been just as big as my EPROM one, the flash chips I bought are
PLCC, which is a lot smaller, but has the same capabilities as the DIP.
The biggest problem with using flash chips is that the largest 32 pin
flash chip is a 4 megabit chip, so when using 2 of them, you get a 1
megabyte cart, which is fine for most games, but there are some 2
megabyte games out there (although they are fairly common games).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts List:</p>
<p><img src="flash/doneopenfront.jpg" height="384" width="406"></p>
<p>You need - Perfboard, two 32pin PLCC sockets, wrapping wire,
and an original VB cart (I used teleroboxer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/willem.jpg" height="239" width="371"></p>
<p><img src="flash/plccadptr.jpg" height="166" width="215"></p>
<p>EPROM programmer, I used the Willem EPROM programmer because
it supported my chips and more devices and is probably the cheapest one
available although slower than my EPROMER. You will also need a PLCC
adapter to program these chips. Both are available from <a href="http://www.willem.org/" target="_blank">www.willem.org</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/chip.jpg" height="134" width="194"></p>
<p>32 pin PLCC chip (mine are 90ns ST M29F040B - 4mbit chips)</p>
<p>And you will also need: a soldering iron, and solder -
available at Radio Shack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Instructions:</p>
<p><img src="carttool.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>First, to open up a cartridge you need a tool, either you can
buy one that fits the cart, or what I did was take an old flat head
screwdriver that was about the width of the hole, then notched out the
center wide enough to grab the center of the screw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/apart.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>Then you need to open up the cart (which cart you use is up to
you, but I picked Teleroboxer because it has battery backed save games
and is fairly cheap)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/prychip.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>After opening, you need to remove the chip which I did by
clamping down the board, taking a chisel to get under the edge of a
corner, then use a soldering iron and to melt the solder and pry up
with the chisel (the chisel works the best because even a small flat
head screwdriver had a hard time getting under the corner of the chip)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/testing.jpg" height="384" width="512"></p>
<p>Then you should test to make sure there are no shorts where
you desoldered the chip, and if you have to, use a pick to scratch away
some excess solder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through Hole Cart:</p>
<p><img src="flash/cartcase.jpg" height="205" width="554"></p>
<p><img src="flash/wires.jpg" height="141" width="324"></p>
<p>Then you are going to need some perfboard and cut it to fit
the cart, then cut the cart casing so the chip socket fits out the
bottom - I used a dremel to cut the holes, and also to thin the casing
so I have more room for the wires with less pressure on them and less
bulge in the casing. Then start jumpering the wires that are in common
with both chips (VCC, address lines, GND, /WE, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="wiretool.jpg" height="237" width="315"></p>
<p>To cut the wires, the fastest way I've found is to decide how
long you want the wires, then make a tool to make the wires that
length. What I did was found a block of wood the size I wanted, drilled
a hole down the middle of it, stuck a screw through it. Then attach it
to a drill and it'll quickly make a new spool the length that you want,
then just take a knife and cut straight across and all the wires are
relatively the same size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to then read <a href="flash/Flashpins.txt" target="_blank">this
file</a> to find out which wires go where, and <a href="flash/PLCCpinout.txt" target="_blank">this
file</a> for the pinout of the throughhole PLCC socket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/doneopenback.jpg" height="404" width="436"></p>
<p>Then you have to solder the wires to each pin individually and
connect them to the correct pins. Although that looks like a huge mess,
as long as you work on it one pin at a time, it isn't really too
difficult, just time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/doneback.jpg" height="429" width="496"></p>
<p>Then after you get the wiers connected, carefully put the the
two boards into the cart case and screw it together - this is what it
looks like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/donefront.jpg" height="402" width="454"></p>
<p>Here's a pic from the front. Now you're ready to program the
chips, put them in, and PLAY GAMES!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/InVB.jpg" height="267" width="490"></p>
<p>Here it is from the bottom. As you can see, it is a lot
smaller than the eprom cart and looks very nice having no wires exposed.</p>
<p>Surface Mount Cart:</p>
<p>Here's just a few pics of my latest flash cart which uses
surface mount sockets, which are a lot lower profile and don't stick
out the back any. The wiring of the cart is the same as the through
hole, but there's just a few differences that I'll note under the
pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/newcartcase.jpg" height="228" width="581"></p>
<p>First, you want to start by cutting holes the size of the
sockets starting from the back wall of the plastic cart (I used a small
drill like bit for the dremel to cut the big part, then used an xacto
knife to finish the edges). Then you will want to give yourself some
extra room inside the cart, so you should trim away some of the inside
of the cart (I used a dremel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/newcartfront.jpg" height="324" width="371"></p>
<p><img src="flash/newcartback.jpg" height="331" width="390"></p>
<p>Here you see the wiring of the chip... same as the other cart,
except instead of having large through holes, you have smaller surface
mount pins (which aren't really THAT hard to solder to). Also notice
that I ran every wire to the edge instead of connecting from chip to
chip, then from one chip to the edge. That was because with the surface
mount chips, there is a lot less room for wires by the chip, so it
works out better to run each individually to the edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="flash/newcartdone.jpg" height="400" width="467"></p>
<p>And the finished product, a completely flush socketed flash
cart. The other version does have it's advantages though... although it
doesn't look as nice, it's easier to swap chips because you can leave
the cart in and only remove the chip, where this version you have to
pull the cart out slightly to remove the chip. But it may be possible
to move the hole back as far as possible and have access to the chip.
WOOHOO! Now I can do some quick programming for the link cable with TWO
flash carts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programming:</p>
<p><img src="flash/willemsoft.jpg" height="360" width="443"></p>
<p>To program, you must first make sure the chips are blank
(click erase to be sure, takes about 7 seconds), then select the chip
type and rom you want to program. Because we have to use two chips, you
must program the High and Low Bytes separately. I believe that you can
do it in this program, but I always split the file first, then program
the whole file. You must also fill the whole chip up with repeats of
the data. After you select the rom, you can put the chip in. Then you
can select program chip. It will take about 5 minutes to program a full
512k chip. After the first chip is done, you can put the second chip in
and do the same process with the other half of the file. Then put the
chips into the cart and you're done!<font size="-1"> </font></p>
