<h1>Reprogrammable EPROM Cartridge</h1>
<img src="eprom/backsystem.jpg" height="368" width="500">
<p>Here's a reprogrammable EPROM cartridge that I built from
plans by David Tucker - <a href="http://www.goliathindustries.com/vb/VBCart.html" target="_blank">His instructions</a>. It works just
like a regular cartridge except you decide what goes on it. I have
tried many different games on it, they all seem to work, including my
homemade Simon game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts List:</p>
<p><img src="eprom/perfboard.jpg" height="263" width="358"></p>
<p>Perfboard and two 32pin (or more - I got 40 pin because
they're easier to find) sockets, and jumpers (optional)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/apart.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>Original VB cart, I used Teleroboxer because it is cheap and
has battery backed save games</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/programmer.jpg" height="313" width="481"></p>
<p>Eprom programmer, I used an EPROMER5 from www.ustr.net . But
the cable is junk, so buy a real one (wouldn't write anything correctly
for me)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/chipsocket.jpg" height="273" width="437"></p>
<p>32 pin EPROMs (27C801's) and ZIF sockets (optional, but easier
than prying out chips)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/eraseropen.jpg" height="152" width="499"></p>
<p>An EPROM UV eraser (mine is a Datarase II) or you can leave
the chips in the sun for a long time or make your own</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you will also need: A spool of wrapping wire, a soldering
iron, and solder - all available at Radio Shack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Instructions:</p>
<p><img src="carttool.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>First, to open up a cartridge you need a tool, either you can
buy one that fits the cart, or what I did was take an old flat head
screwdriver that was about the width of the hole, then notched out the
center wide enough to grab the center of the screw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/apart.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>Then you need to open up the cart (which cart you use is up to
you, but I picked Teleroboxer because it has battery backed save games
and is fairly cheap)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/prychip.jpg" height="336" width="448"></p>
<p>After opening, you need to remove the chip which I did by
clamping down the board, taking a chisel to get under the edge of a
corner, then use a soldering iron and to melt the solder and pry up
with the chisel (the chisel works the best because even a small flat
head screwdriver had a hard time getting under the corner of the chip)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/testing.jpg" height="384" width="512"></p>
<p>Then you should test to make sure there are no shorts where
you desoldered the chip, and if you have to, use a pick to scratch away
some excess solder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/perfboard.jpg" height="263" width="358"></p>
<p>Then you are going to need some perfboard and IC sockets (at
least 32 pin, but I used 40 pin because they're easier to find), then
cut it to the approximate shape that you want it. You can put the chips
just about any way you can think of, but I put them side by side so it
doesn't stick out much in the back, but you can make it as the VB Cart,
but about twice as long. I will get to the jumpers in the middle later.
Remember, we have not soldered anything yet, those are just sitting in
the holes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/pieces.jpg" height="198" width="387"></p>
<p>Then you're going to want to test the fit, make any
notches/holes to fit better, and try actually sticking it into the VB
(do it now, because it will be harder to modify later)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="wiretool.jpg" height="237" width="315"></p>
<p>To cut the wires, the fastest way I've found is to decide how
long you want the wires, then make a tool to make the wires that
length. What I did was found a block of wood the size I wanted, drilled
a hole down the middle of it, stuck a screw through it. Then attach it
to a drill and it'll quickly make a new spool the length that you want,
then just take a knife and cut straight across and all the wires are
relatively the same size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to then read <a href="eprom/EPROMpins.txt" target="_blank">this
file</a> to find out which wires go where</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/begboardwire.jpg" height="357" width="383"></p>
<p>Next, you want to put the socket in the holes, and slide the
wires that are duplicate with the other side in each hole (saves
running two wires to the cart edge which is very crowded), then run
them to the other side and put them in the same holes. Then you will
want to solder them in (you may want to solder the extra pins in first
if you got a 40 pin socket so it stays in place when you move it
around) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/cartopen.jpg" height="332" width="290"></p>
<p>This is after soldering in the duplicate wires to the front</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/brdwireback.jpg" height="360" width="452"></p>
<p>Then you will need to solder the wires to the back of the
board. The jumpers are so you can use a flash EPROM chip instead of
standard UV erasable EPROM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/backback.jpg" height="278" width="354"></p>
<p>Next, you need to solder the wires from the EPROM board to the
VB Cart board. The best way I found to do this was to clamp the EPROM
board, and clamp a 2x4 to the bench and use it to support the VB Cart
board while you solder all the wires (be careful, they are very small
and brittle)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/donebckcart.jpg" height="253" width="346"></p>
<p>Then after you get the wiers connected, carefully put the the
two boards into the cart case</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/cart.jpg" height="328" width="427"></p>
<p>Then you're ready to put the ZIF sockets in, program the
chips, put them in, and PLAY GAMES!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="eprom/frontsystem.jpg" height="389" width="515"></p>
<p>Here it is from the top, as you can see, it doesn't stick out
too far in the back, and doesn't cause as much bend in the cart</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programming:</p>
<p><img src="eprom/program.jpg" height="382" width="552"></p>
<p>To program, you must first make sure the chips are blank (mine
take about 15mins in the eraser), then select the chip type and rom you
want to program. Because we have to use two chips, you must program the
High and Low Bytes separately. You can do it in this program, but there
are many bugs in it that it is better to split the file first, then
program the whole file. You must also fill the whole chip up with
repeats of the data. After you select the rom, you can put the chip in
and select Blank Chk to make sure it is completly erased. Then you can
select program. It will take about two minutes to program a full 1MB
chip, then you should verify it. After the first chip is done, you can
put the second chip in and do the same process with the other half of
the file. Then put the chips into the cart and you're done! </p>
