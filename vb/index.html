<h1>Long overdue site redesign, plus some cool new projects coming</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">08/23/2008 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a></div>
<p align="left">Here's the new site design... I'm still in the process
of getting all the pages back up, but I'll get that finished shortly,
followed by a new update in content.</p>
<h1>Site back up on new webspace, plus lots of updates</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">07/17/2006 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a></div>
<p align="left">WOW! Sorry about the HUGE delay in this
update, and sorry about the site downtime. I promise I've still been
VB'ing, just been too busy to update, and I've switched ISPs, so that's
what caused the downtime :-(. Thanks to Ferry from <a href="http://www.virtual-boy.org" target="_blank">www.virtual-boy.org</a>
for the
webspace. Anyway, for those that care, I've been busy with work and
school mostly, I got my AS in Computer Science back in Dec. 03 from <a href="http://www.nvcc.edu/" target="_blank">NVCC</a>,
and for the last two years I've been going to <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">George
Mason University</a> for a BS in Electrical Engineering. I can't
wait to get done with school, I've got one more semester :-). I've also
been collecting arcade games and pinball machines... right now I've got
over 40 coin-op machines, with (lack of) space being my worst enemy
&gt;_&lt;.</p>
<p align="left">Now for the updates... I'll try to
remember everything ;-). First, I've added a new section on fixing the
glitchy display problems. This has become a MAJOR problem recently (and
Nintendo has stopped repairing VBs :-( ), and after explaining how to
fix it to lots of people, I figured I'd put up a tutorial on it (and
also some stuff on modifying a security bit to work in the deep holes).
I also got my hands on an official Nintendo VB EPROM cartridge, so I
added pics and some info on that to the Reprogrammable Cart section.
I've also made a reprogrammable cart PCB, which I've also added into
the Reprogrammable Cart section. Sorry, they're not for sale yet... but
I should have a few for sale eventually. I've been working on a progam
to flash the cart from the VB (sending the data over the link port),
that way you don't need an EPROM programmer, but it's still in the
works (it works, but isn't complete yet). Oh yeah... the last unknown
pin on the cart edge (pin 5) is a /WE!!! I also picked up a USB Virtual
Boy controller kit from <a href="http://www.retrousb.com" target="_blank">www.retrousb.com</a> and it works
great, so I put a page on that up in the controller section. Oh, and I
reorganized a lot of my site (the behind the scenes stuff), so let me
know if you find any broken links.</p>
<p align="left">Coming soon (this is more of a reminder
for myself than trying to get you excited about the next update ;-) ):
I've successfully built a link cable to go from the VB link
port-&gt;PC parallel port. So far I've done some simple speed tests
and made a cart dumping program (with a CRC32 check to ensure a good
dump). Thanks to Frostgiant (are you still out there???) for the help
on the dumping program. I've also overclocked a VB... it works, and it
is faster, but because the mirrors are dependent on the timing of the
rest of the system, the display is messed up (the system runs stable to
28MHz, at 33MHz the system gets glitchy, and at 40MHz, it won't start).
Speeding the mirrors up proportionally should help the display problem.
I've also been doing a lot of VB programming, mostly just hardware
tests and demos, but I've also been working on a Mario game, which I'll
get some pics and maybe a ROM of up of soon. I've also gotten some more
game endings (V-Tetris, NFB, Insmouse, Golf, Mario Clash), some of
which I think I already added, but I'll have to make sure. I'll get all
of that information and code up hopefully in the next update (it's been
so long, I have no idea where that stuff is anymore).</p>
<p align="left">Obviously you've found my new web address
(or it's still being redirected from <a href="http://projectvb.vze.com">http://projectvb.vze.com</a>), but if
you find any broken links, please let me know. Of course since you're
reading this the page is up, but I'm still in the process of uploading
all of the new content so it may be a short while before all of the
promised updates are available. Also, for those who haven't noticed, my
email has changed too... it's virtual .dot. boy @at@ comcast .dot. net.</p>
<h1>Controllers and other random stuff</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">06/09/2003 |&nbsp;<a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
</div>
<p align="left"> Finally, another update! VB work has been
a little slow lately because of finals and that kinda stuff... but now
it's summer, so here's some of the projects I've been working on.
First, I've made a new controller section for a few controller
modifications and related stuff... I've got a lot more controller
related stuff than I put up, but it's not really the top on my
priorities to finish. In the controller section right now is the start
of a how-to for an adapter to use NES/SNES controllers on the VB, and a
VB controller with two outputs so you can control multiple VB's with
one controller. I also added a how-to for a rechargable VB battery
pack. And thanks to Parasyte for pointing out an article with a cheat
to access a debug menu in Red Alarm, and for finding two more cheats in
Jack Bros... those are in the cheats section. I also added a pic of a
new "tool" for making cartridges in the reprogrammable cart sections.
Lastly, I uploaded the ending description/pics for Virtual Fishing.</p>
<h1>Homebrew stuff released, plus more pinout info</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">04/19/2003 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Ugh... I STILL haven't gotten the
projects I've been wanting to get up... but I did add two more pins to
the cart pinout, leaving only pin 5 to figure out. Also, thanks to
RedAlarm for sending me a scan of an article from GMR which does a
short overview of the Virtual Boy, although it's a really crappy
article, it's interesting to see :-P. And lastly, finally I'm releasing
the ROMs / source to my apps / games that I've programmed for the VB,
so those check out <a href="programming.html">HERE</a>.</p>
<h1>VUE-Debugger</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">03/08/2003 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> This is a quick update with some pics and
info on the VUE-Debugger that I'm borrowing from a friend. Check it out
under the Virtual Boy Development section. I'll get more info up later
when I get it working, and I've got some more projects I'd like to get
up, but I'm going out of town for Spring Break next week :-), so it'll
be a couple weeks until the next update.</p>
<h1>VB systems talk over the Link Cable</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">02/19/2003 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Here's an update that I've been trying to
get up for the last few weeks, but just haven't gotten around to it...
I've gotten 2 VB's actually communicating over the link cable, so I put
up a link cable diagram as I think it should be. I also put up an
updated cartridge pinout. Also, Tonight I made another flash cart, so I
put up a few pics of that one. There were a few other things I was
trying to get put up, but I guess they'll have to wait until the next
update. And for those of you that were having problems with the old
java menu, I made a temporary html one until I get a better one.</p>
<h1>Reading SRAM, plus game endings</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">01/16/2003 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Happy New Year everyone! The biggest part
of this update is my new how-to on reading / writing the SRAM with a
Game Boy SRAM read/writer, which is under the reprogrammable cart
section. I also added some new game endings, including Virtual Lab and
SD Gundam.</p>
<h1>Merry Christmas! &nbsp;More Prototype pics/info!</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">12/25/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Merry Christmas everyone! I added a
little more info / the rest of the pics I have right now of the protos,
and made their own pages for each. Also, for mac owners, ViBE 1.0b2 has
been released! Now I'm just hoping for a PC version *hint hint* :-)</p>
<h1>Flash Cart info, plus Tech Specs</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">12/18/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Here's the follow-up that I promised...
basically, I just added the info on the flash cart, a little more info
on the technical specs of the VB, and updated the VB ROM list. I'll try
to get more pics / info up on the protos soon, but I've got to study
for my calc final for tomorrow :-(, but then I'm off for a month!</p>
<h1>Prototypes Surfaced! &nbsp;Faceball and Virtual Bowling!</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">12/18/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Well, MANY thanks go out to the
mysterious VB collector "Mr. G"! for sending me pictures and
information on the only known prototypes, Faceball and Virtual
Bowling!!! I am still working on completing the rest of my update, but
for the time being, you can view the pics / info of the protos here!
I have been in contact with him and am trying to get more pics /
information on them, so expect more to come soon, along with
information on my flash reprogrammable cartridge and a few other things
I've been working on over the past few months.</p>
<h1>Find me at projectvb.vze.com, plus other stuff</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">11/17/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> This is mostly just a follow-up update,
there are still some parts that aren't completed, but I just needed to
put up what I had. First, you can access my page from an easier to
remember address... it is <a href="http://projectvb.vze.com/" target="_blank">http://projectvb.vze.com</a> . Now for
the update, I added information on the painting of the Virtual Boy, I
added some technical information, added a picture of 2 VB's linked
together (still in process of figuring out the link port), and I
scanned in pics of some VB merchandise (Virtual T-Shirt... is it really
there? or should it be Virtual <b>Boy</b> T-Shirt :-) )
from a Super Power Club (Nintendo Power subscribers) pamphlet... thanks
to Neil Schuldenfrei for pointing that out.</p>
<h1>Lots of new VB Development stuff</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">10/25/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Well, after WAY too long of no updates, I
hope you all enjoy this one. I have done a lot of work lately on the
development of the Virtual Boy. In my update, I added a few new
sections including a how-to for a cart dumper, a reprogrammable EPROM
cart, I started an emulation/programming page which will be updated in
my next update (soon), I added a section on painting my VB which will
also be updated next time, and I did a short how-to on modifying your
link port to use a standard RJ45 jack. BTW, the how-to's aren't
finished yet, I just put them up so you all could see it. I will
complete the how-to's in my next update. I also cleaned up my links
section a little.</p>
<h1>And some more game endings</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">06/13/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> I updated my game endings section with
the pictures I took a while back... I'll be continuing to work on it,
but that is probably going to be the most progress on it in one update
for a while. Other than that, we changed the server where the Virtual
Boy Chat room is located.</p>
<h1>More game endings</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">05/15/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left">I have updated my game endings section
with a few more games, thanks to Ferry for letting me rip his game
endings. I still have some more to go, and I have personally been going
through some of the games to get pictures of the endings, which will be
up on my next update.</p>
<h1>New name, same great taste</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">04/26/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left">I have changed the name of my site from
"Pat's Virtual Boy Page" to Project: Virtual Boy (Project: VB). I have
also added a new section for game endings. The game endings is still
under construction, but I hope to continue to work towards getting a
fairly complete game endings page.</p>
<h1>ViBE released</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">04/04/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> 4/4/02 - I have added to the menu a link
to the new Virtual Boy chat room. Also, big news for mac owners - ViBE,
the macintosh Virtual Boy emulator has been released to the public. I
personally have tried it out, and it works very well. It can be
downloaded at <a href="http://www.bannister.org/software/vibe.htm" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
<h1>Store Displays</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">03/23/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> 3/23/02 - Finally, another real update. I
added a new section to my site with pictures and descriptions of my two
store display units.</p>
<h1>Webspace Changes, I'm back!</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">02/25/2002 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> Finally got my webspace back... I'm glad
you found it. Anyway, no change in content, just put it all back up to
the new server since my previous internet provider went bankrupt, so it
should be here for a while. Also my email address has changed to <a href="mailto:virtual.boy@mchsi.com">virtual.boy@mchsi.com</a>
. Please tell me if there are any broken links, pages that will not
show, or still have a link to my old email address. I tried to fix them
all, but may have forgotten a few.</p>
<h1>New Menu</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">07/04/2001 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left"> This is a very small update... Pretty
much all that has changed is the new java menu bar on the side. Please
email me if you have problems viewing the new bar, or is extremely
slow. I plan on adding more of these nice looking java bars if they
seem compatible with everybody's internet browsers.</p>
<h1>New update page, and some minor updates</h1>
<div class="htimeauth">06/21/2001 | <a href="mailto:virtual.dot.boy@at@comcast.dot.net">DogP</a>
<br>
</div>
<p align="left">The first update is this long needed
update page. While I was working on it, I decided to make a few minor
cosmetic changes. I also added some new things to the cheats section
(Nester's Funky Bowling and Mario Clash).</p>
