Carefully install the new modified ROM into U6 (with the notch facing RIGHT) and the new NVRAM into U7 (with the notch facing LEFT).<br>
Ensure all pins are aligned in the sockets before pushing into the sockets to avoid damaging the pins.<br>
ENSURE THE CHIPS ARE INSERTED IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION OR THEY WILL BE DAMAGED<br>

<h3>NOTES:</h3>
-Install at your own risk.  Make sure your game is unplugged before working on it.  If you're not comfortable working with electronics, ask for help from someone that is.<br>
-You'll need a small flathead screwdriver or chip lifter to remove the original chips. Be careful and gentle when removing.<br>
-The new chips MUST be inserted in the correct direction, and with the pins carefully lined up in the socket to prevent damage.<br>
